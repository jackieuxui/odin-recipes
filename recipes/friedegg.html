    <h1> Fried Egg </h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>A fried egg is a simple yet satisfying dish made by 
        cracking an egg into a hot pan with a small amount of 
        oil or butter and cooking it until the egg white is set 
        while the yolk remains runny. As the heat transforms the 
        egg, the white turns opaque and forms a delicate, slightly 
        crispy edge, encasing the rich, golden yolk. The yolk itself
         offers a creamy, velvety texture and a luscious, savory 
         flavor that contrasts beautifully with the subtle saltiness 
         of the egg white. Whether enjoyed on its own, atop toast,
          or as a versatile addition to countless recipes, a perfectly
           fried egg is a timeless culinary delight.

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>raw egg</li>
        <li>olive oil or butter</li>
        <li> optional: salt</li>
        <li> optional: pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add a small amount of oil or butter to the pan and let it melt or heat up.</li>
        <li>Crack an egg into a small bowl or directly into the pan.</li>
        <li>Gently slide the egg from the bowl into the pan, being careful not to break the yolk.</li>
        <li>Let the egg cook undisturbed until the white is set and the edges turn crispy, usually for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you prefer the yolk to be runny, cook the egg for a shorter time. For a firmer yolk, cook it for a bit longer.</li>
        <li>Season the egg with salt and pepper or any desired seasonings.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the fried egg to a plate and serve it as desired.</li>
